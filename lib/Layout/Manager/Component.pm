=head1 NAME

Layout::Manager::Component - Component Role

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Layout::Manager resizes and repositions components.  This role provides the
blueprint for your objects to be moveable by Layout::Manager.  Simply add this
role to your class and implement the required methods.

    package My::Widget;
    use Moose;
    
    with 'Layout::Manager::Component';

    has 'width' ...
    has 'height' ...
    has 'origin' ...

This role does not provide an implementation of these methods.  This might be
surprising because it _could_.  I originally intended to implement the
attributes here and use the role in L<Geoemtry::Primitive> or
L<Graphics::Primitive> but it would've created a circular dependency, so I
opted to leave this bit of yak shaving up to you.  This may change in the
future as the APIs of these modules solidifies.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item name

Name of this component.  Used to find specific components after they've been
added to this layout manager.

=item height

Set/get the height of the component.

=item width

Remove all components from the layout manager.

=item origin

Set/get the origin point of this component.  This is expected to be a
L<Geometry::Primitive::Point> object.

=item minimum_height

Set/get the minimum height for this component. Defaults to 0.

=item minimum_width

Set/get the minimum width for this component.  Defaults to 0.

=item preferred_height

Set/get the preferred height for this component. Defaults to 0.

=item preferred_height

Set/get the minimum height for this component. Defaults to 0.
