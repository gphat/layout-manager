=head1 NAME

Layout::Manager - 2D Layout Management

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Layout::Manager provides a simple interface for creating layout managers, or
classes that size and position components withing a container.

A few managers are provided for reference, but this module is primarily meant
to serve as a base for outside implementations.

    use Layout::Manager;

    my $foo = Layout::Manager->new;
    $foo->do_layout($component);

=head1 USING A LAYOUT MANAGER

Layout::Manager relies on L<Graphics::Primitive::Container> as a source for
it's components.

Various implementations of Layout::Manager will require you do add components
with slightly different second arguments, but the general case will be:

  $lm->add_component($comp, $constraints);

The contents of B<$constraints> must be discerned by reading the documentation
for the layout manager you are using.

The B<$comp> argument must be a L<Graphics::Primitive::Component>.

Layout manager works hand-in-hand with Graphics::Primitive, so you'll want to
check out the L<lifecyle|Graphics::Primitive::Component#LIFECYCLE> documented
in L<Graphics::Primitive::Component>.  It will look something like this:

  $cont->add_component($foo, { some => metadata });
  $driver->prepare($cont);
  my $lm = new Layout::Manager::SomeImplementation;
  $lm->do_layout($cont);
  $driver->pack($cont);
  $driver->draw($cont);

When you are ready to lay out your container, you'll need to call the
L<do_layout> method with a single argument: the component in which you are
laying things out. When I<do_layout> returns all of the components should be
resized and repositioned according to the rules of the Layout::Manager
implementation.

=head2 PREPARATION

Subsequent calls to do_layout will be ignored if the Container is prepared.
The Container's C<prepared> flag and the flags of all it's children are
checked, so any modifications to B<any> child component will cause the entire
container (and any container children) to be laid out again.

=head1 WRITING A LAYOUT MANAGER

Layout::Manager provides all the methods necessary for your implementation,
save the I<do_layout> method.  This method will be called when it is time to
layout the components.

The I<add_component> method takes two arguments: the component and a second,
abritrary piece of data.  If your layout manager is simple, like 
L<Compass|Layout::Manager::Compass>, you may only require a simple variable
like "NORTH".  If you create something more complex the second argument may be
a hashref or an object.

The value of the I<components> method is an arrayref of hashrefs.  The
hashrefs have two keys:

=over 

=item B<component>

The component to be laid out.

=item B<args>

The argument provided to I<add_component>.

=back

=head1 TIPS

Layout manager implementations should honor the I<visible> attribute of a
component, as those components need to be ignored.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item I<do_layout>

Lays out this manager's components in the specified container.

=item I<overflow>

Indicates that the contents of this layout manager have exceeded it's size.
If you care, you should check this after performing a do_layout.
